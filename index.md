Welcome to my personal webpage. I am an astronomer and Full Professor at the Data and Artificial Intelligence Initiative (IDIA) at Universidad de Chile. I am director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics (MAS) since 2024, Research Scientist at the Center for Mathematical Modelling (CMM) at Universidad de Chile, and Associate Researcher at the The Center of Excellence in Astrophysics and Related Technologies (CATA). I am mostly interested in astroinformatics and supernova science. I used to be the principal investigator of the High Cadence Transiente Survey (HiTS, 2012-2018) and of the Automatic Learning for the Rapid Classification of Events (ALeRCE) Vera C. Rubin Community broker (2018-2024). I led the installation of the CHASE 500 cm robotic telescope in CTIO (first light Oct 2010). I did my Ph.D. thesis on Type Ia Supernovae progenitors at the University of Oxford (2009) with Prof. Philipp Podsiadlowski.
